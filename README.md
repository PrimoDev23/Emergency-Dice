# Emergency Dice

This mod adds five new items (and more coming soon):
* Emergency Die
* The Gambler
* Chronos
* The Sacrificer
* Pathfinding blobs (not a dice item)

## Emergency Die

This is an item you can buy from the store.
It is a one time use only die, which teleports you to the ship with all your items.
There's one catch though. It has a 50/50 chance of working.

* Rolling 6 will return you to the ship with all the crewmates standing near you (they need to be very close).
* Rolling 4 or 5 will return you to the ship.
* Rolling 3 has a mixed effect. It can be bad, it can be good.
* Rolling 2 will cause something bad to happen.
* You don't want to roll a 1.

## The Gambler

A new scrap item with rolling outcomes similar to the Emergency die,
but with a larger pool of effects and a bigger chance for a bad outcome.

* Rolling 6 will cause a Great effect.
* Rolling 5 will cause a Good effect.
* Rolling 4 will cause either a Good or a Mixed effect.
* Rolling 3 will cause a Bad effect.
* Rolling 2 will cause either a Bad or an Awful effect.
* Rolling 1 will cause an Awful effect.

You can either sell it, or use it.

## Chronos

Similar to The Gambler. Has a higher chance of getting a great effect,
but the outcomes change when the time passes. As the night
comes, the chances to roll a bad/awful effect increase.

* Rolling 6 will cause a Great effect.
* Rolling 5 will cause a Good or a Great effect.
* Rolling 4 will cause either a Bad, Good or a Great effect.
* Rolling 3 will cause a Bad effect.
* Rolling 2 will cause either a Bad or an Awful effect.
* Rolling 1 will cause an Awful effect.

You can either sell it, or use it.


## The Sacrificer

Guarantees a return to the ship, and a bad effect.

* Rolling 6 will cause a Bad effect.
* Rolling 5 will cause a Bad effect.
* Rolling 4 will cause a Bad effect.
* Rolling 3 will cause a Bad or an Awful effect.
* Rolling 2 will cause an Awful effect.
* Rolling 1 will cause two Awful effects.
