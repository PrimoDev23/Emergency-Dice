# Emergency Dice

This mod adds two new items (and more coming soon):
* Emergency Die
* The Gambler

## Emergency Die

This is an item you can buy from the store.
It is a one time use only die, which teleports you to the ship with all your items.
There's one catch though. It has a 50/50 chance of working.

* Rolling 6 will return you to the ship with all the crewmates standing near you (they need to be very close).
* Rolling 4 or 5 will return you to the ship.
* Rolling 3 has a mixed effect. It can be bad, it can be good.
* Rolling 2 will cause something bad to happen.
* You don't want to roll a 1.

## The Gambler

A new scrap item. Similar to the Emergency Die,
but it has more positive effects.
Rolling outcomes are similar to the Emergency die,
but with a slightly higher chances for a worse effect.

Basically, a lower number means a worse effect,
a higher number means a better effect.

You can either sell it, or use it.


## Effects

### Positive

* Heals all alive players and restores their batteries in every item
* Teleports you to the ship with your items
* Spawns about 3-9 (random) scrap items beneath you with a lower weight.
* Revives every dead player
* More to come

### Negative

* Spawns a jester in a popped state, and pops all already existing jesters.
* Creates a lot of fake fire exits
